While these apples are indeed past their prime and have brown spots from being overripe, they are not quite rotten. They may not look as nice as some of our fresher stock, but they are still perfectly edible. If you prepare them in a pie or other baked goods where the spots can be removed, they will be just as delicious. Would you reconsider purchasing a carton at our affordable $20 price point?
