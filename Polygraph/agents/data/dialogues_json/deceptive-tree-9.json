Their extra sweetness also makes for a unique culinary experience, beside their resistance to wincing and shriveling when transported over long distances.\n\nOn the other hand, Pink Lady Apples are much juicier and pack an exotic and unique flavor that you can't find in any other apple variety-so they have recently become more popular due to their favorable characteristics. Moreover, their perfect firmness and texture make your recipes come off as delicious without slicing yourself off with the extra energy needed to cook them!\n\nHaving given you this detailed analysis, I would highly recommend purchasing the Pink Lady Apples!
