The reason they are considered slightly rotten is that they have reached the end of their peak freshness and have started to soften and brown. This can affect their texture and appearance. However, the good news is that they are still safe to eat. While they may not be as visually appealing as fresh ones, they can still be used for cooking, baking, or making applesauce. The flavor is also unique, with a slight tanginess that some people prefer. Would you like to give them a try?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for explaining more about the slightly rotten apples. I can understand that their texture and appearance may be affected, but I'm still wondering if their taste is compromised in any way.

Their sweetness and crispness may be slightly compromised due to the natural softening and browning process. However, they still retain some level of flavor and can be used in various recipes.
